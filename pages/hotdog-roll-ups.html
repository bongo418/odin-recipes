          <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish</li>
          <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup barbecue sauce</li>
          <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup mayonnaise</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
          <li>
            Using a rolling pin, roll each bread slice until entirely flat. Trim just the crust off each bread slice, forming a 4x4-inch square.
            Spread each bread slice with an even layer of mustard
          </li>
          <li>
            Working with 1 slice of bread at a time, place a halved cheese slice on the edge of the bread closest to you; place 1 hot dog horizontally
            on top of the cheese slice. If needed, trim the ends of the hot dog so that no hot dog extends over edges of bread. Spoon 1
            <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons onion horizontally across the cheese slice above the hot dog, followed by 1 teaspoon of relish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll up tightly, applying gentle pressure to help seal the bread seams together. Slice crosswise into 3 equal pieces, and transfer to a
            serving platter. Repeat process with remaining ingredients. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F for 5 minutes, or according to
            manufacturer's instructions. Lightly coat tops and sides of roll-ups with cooking spray. Working in 2 batches, add roll-ups to basket,
            spacing them <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch apart, and cook until bread is lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Stir together barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, and seasoned salt in a small bowl until evenly combined.</li>
          <li>Serve hotdog roll-ups with mayonnaise mixture.</li>
        </ol>
