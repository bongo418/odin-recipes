        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been
            absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Keep warm.
          </li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Toss cubed sweet potatoes in 1 tablespoon oil. Spread evenly on a baking sheet.</li>
          <li>Roast sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until tender but not too soft, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Heat a cast iron skillet with 1 tablespoon coconut oil over medium-high heat; add red, green, and orange bell peppers and saute for 2 to 3
            minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add remaining 1 tablespoon coconut oil to the same skillet. Add tofu evenly. Cook for 2 minutes and gently flip to the other side.
            Continue cooking, turning occasionally, until tofu gets a little crisp on the edges, 6 to 8 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add jerk marinade, being deliberate about making sure tofu is covered. Once tofu starts to caramelize from the marinade, remove from heat.
          </li>
          <li>Warm black beans in a microwave-safe dish until hot, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.</li>
          <li>Assemble grain bowls: divide rice, tofu, peppers, sweet potatoes, and black beans evenly into individual serving bowls.</li>
        </ol>
